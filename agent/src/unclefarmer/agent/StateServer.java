/**
 * Exposes the world state to a controller outside the JVM, over a line protocol on loopback.
 *
 * Connecting: the server takes the first free port in {@link #FIRST_PORT}..{@link #LAST_PORT}, so
 * several game clients can run side by side, and makes up a fresh random secret every launch. Both
 * go in the port file `agent.<pid>.port` in the output folder, as "port pid secret". The first line
 * of every connection must be `auth <secret>`; anything else is refused and the connection closed.
 * That keeps other programs on this PC (and web pages poking at localhost) from driving the game.
 * tools/agentlink.py does all of this for the Python side.
 *
 * After that, send a command line, get one line back:
 *
 *   state          -> the JSON snapshot from {@link World} (built from packets)
 *   mem            -> the JSON snapshot from {@link Memory} (read from the game's own objects)
 *   mem <section>  -> one part of it: map, self, entities, bag, slots, modes, ui or state
 *                     (state is map+self+entities, the lean snapshot the bot reads each iteration)
 *   memprobe       -> our own entity field by field, beside the packet view, to check the field map
 *   memfind <n>    -> every field under the world holding n (or 'text'), to locate a stat
 *   ping           -> pong
 *   health         -> whether the game is still sound: out-of-memory errors so far, threads, heap
 *   version        -> "mwagent <VERSION>"; the bot refuses an agent older than it needs
 *   keys           -> whether the game's key handler is resolved
 *   speech [on|off] -> the game's own speech: report, restore or silence it (sounds keep playing)
 *   voicefix [on|off] -> the game's voice message player: mended (on, the default) or as the game plays it
 *   wear [since]   -> equipment wear warnings from combat (about to break / broken) after since (ms)
 *   pms [after] [ms] -> private messages received after message number `after`, oldest first;
 *                     with ms, waits up to that long for one to arrive (answers the moment it does)
 *   pm <id> <text> -> send a private message, as the game's private chat line does (armed)
 *   closegame      -> close the game, as its window's close button does (armed)
 *   arm            -> allow this connection to act; everything below needs it
 *   team             -> teammates on our map, as the game answered the quick phrase "/6"
 *   phrase <slot> <text> -> set quick phrase 1-12 the way its window does (armed)
 *   guardmods on|off -> while on, the player's own Shift/Ctrl/Alt are not recorded in this game
 *                    (the connection closing turns it off again)
 *   key <k> [ms]   -> press and release a key, held for ms (default 60). Names: a..z 0..9,
 *                     num0..num9, up down left right, space enter esc tab backspace, f1..f12,
 *                     . , ; / ' - = [ ] \, lctrl rctrl alt shift. Combinations: lctrl+alt+up
 *   keydown <k> / keyup <k> / keysup -> hold, release, release everything. Held keys are
 *                     released automatically when this connection closes.
 *
 * Bound to 127.0.0.1 only, so nothing off this machine can reach it.

    static final int VERSION = 52;   // 4: dialog, real selected target; 5: input/type/typeenter/typeclear; 6: mem beasts/equipment/skills/pets/bagfull, input mode; 7: typeesc, attack_page; 8: capslock key; 9: casts, bag item type; 10: F1 options in mem modes; 11: ` key, sheet load/fusion/counter; 12: drop time; 13: several clients at once (GamePorts), window titles; 14: speech on/off, vitals (R key), sheet contribution/xp_needed/merit; 15: pms, pm, closegame; 16: pms waits for a message; 17: a failing command answers {"ok":false,"error"} instead of dropping the connection, and a closing connection lets go only of the keys it held; 18: casts are read from lines that carry equipment wear, and `wear` reports that wear; 19: vitals carry how many buffs and debuffs are on us; 20: speech off also silences the voices themselves (screen reader, SAPI, own voices), so the combat announcer goes quiet too; 21: speech off also gates the screen reader's cancel, so a silenced game no longer cuts the player's NVDA off; 22: `mem self` points (T key: rage/marks/combos, fusion, pet amiability), entities carry the game's side and kind npc/monster/other; 23: a key we send no longer counts as Left Ctrl + key when the player is holding Left Ctrl in another window (it re-bound hotkeys), and the bot's keys go straight onto the game's input queue instead of through its keyboard hook with focus faked; 24: the points key's answer is read at last (its one-byte request was dropped, so `mem self` never had rage, marks or combos); 25: `said`: the game's last spoken lines (an NPC that answers without a menu); 26: `guardmods on|off`: the player's Shift/Ctrl/Alt are not recorded in this game while a run has it on (they turned the bot's keys into Ctrl+key hotkey bindings); 27: `team` (teammates on our map, from the "/6" quick phrase's answer) and `phrase <slot> <text>`; 28: `casts` rows carry the cast's hit results (critical hits, dodges) when the game sent them; 29: with guardmods on, the game's keyboard hook still sees the player's own Alt (and Shift, Ctrl) - only the hook - so Alt+Tab leaves the game again; the bot's keys still never pick them up; 30: `casts` also carries the monster deaths the game reported (`deaths`: [id, ms]) and keeps 256 casts, so the bot counts every kill it had a hand in; 31: `mem self` carries the pet's HP and MP (pet_vitals, the pet HP key's answer) and its description (pet_info: amiability, HP and MP with their maximums, from the pet panel); 32: `chat <after> [ms]` (the chat channels' lines, in memory only) and `say <channel> <text>` (a line through the game's own sender, no keys); 33: `say 6` (the private channel players join, not private messages), and `say 5`/`say 6` go to the international room and private channel the game's chat model has joined; 34: `pms` also carries the private messages we sent (typed in the game or by the bot, "mine": true, id and name = who it went to), and `idof <name>` finds a player's id from the players seen and messaged this game; 35: every line we send (`say`, `pm`) goes through one queue that waits for the game's own last-sent time (2 s, 3 s on global, shared by all channels and private messages), resends a line the game dropped, and cuts a text over 200 characters into parts at a space; 36: `health` (out-of-memory errors in any game thread or the agent, thread count, heap), so the bot tells a game that ran out of memory and froze from a stuck walk; 37: `mem state` (map+self+entities without bag/slots/modes/ui), and TCP_NODELAY on both ends of the reply; 38: `keysup` and `keyup` release only the keys this connection holds, so one controller in a game can't drop another's; 39: `ask vitals` / `ask petvitals` send the own-HP and pet HP keys' request without a key (the same bytes through the game's own connection); 40: `use <uid>` uses a bag item as its use key and hotkeys do (no arrow keys), `select <id>` makes a monster the game's target as the target keys do; 41: `select` takes only what the target keys would (their reach, the game's line of sight with door edges, unselectable flags) and answers `refused: <id> <why>` otherwise; 42: voice messages - `chat` and `pms` rows carry "voice": <name> for one, `voice play <name>` decodes it with the game's codec into a WAV file, `voice record`, `voice send <3|4>`, `voice send pm <id>` and `voice cancel` record from the game's microphone and send it as the game does; 43: `ask sheet` asks for our character sheet as the sheet key does and keeps the answer off the screen (read into `mem self` sheet, no window), and two connections pressing one key at once can't both count it as theirs; 44: every cast in `casts` says whom it struck and their HP after it ("targets"), other players' casts too; 45: `slot <n> [sustain] [lock]` does what attack key n does on the page that is up, through the game's own key method, without the keyboard; 46: a `slot` press is let go 30 ms later as the key is (world.a(0L)), so the game no longer takes the attack key for held down and stops every walk after it; 47: a key tap (or a combination's modifier) another connection is holding is no longer let go, a held key's repeat can't put it down again just after it was let go, `use` retries a bag the game is changing, `state`/`team` numbers keep a decimal point in every locale, and positions survive the clock's 50-day turn; 48: the game's folder goes into game_folder.txt beside the logs, so the app finds the game it is installed in, and into agent.<pid>.folder for that game alone (the copy a character's phrases are in); 49: `mem skills` carries each profession skill's rank (profession_ranks, from the login list the client drops it from), so gathering knows how far the character's Fishing, Mining or Collect Herbs goes; 50: `mem self` sheet carries the Vitality left (the sheet's "Vitality 44.7"), which gathering spends; 51: the game's voice player opens each message at its own rate and skips a half-read one (VoicePlayer), so a second game no longer plays every voice message slow and deep; `voicefix [on|off]` switches that off and on; 52: a Priest's points key request (op=23 with the PK mode byte) counts too, so a Priest's `mem self` points carry the pet's amiability
