"""The Java agent and the Python client must agree on the wire protocol.

StateServer.VERSION says what the jar can do. Every AGENT_* gate in runner.py says what the Python
client expects before sending a command. If Python expects a newer protocol than the jar provides,
the app can ship commands the agent does not understand; comparing the two here makes that a red
test instead of a failed run.
