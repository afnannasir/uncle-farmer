"""Updates from the GitHub releases of Uncle Farmer, on one of two channels.

  master  stable releases: a tag "v<version>" (v0.2.0) with one asset, UncleFarmer-<version>.zip,
          published by hand (release.py). GitHub's "latest release", which never is a pre-release.
  dev     development builds of the dev branch, published by CI (ci.yml, ci_build.py publish-dev):
          a PRE-release tagged "v<version>-dev.<build>" with UncleFarmer-<version>-dev.<build>.zip.
          <version> is the last stable release's, <build> the CI run number, so 0.9.0-dev.57 is a
          build made after 0.9.0, newer than 0.9.0 and older than 0.10.0 (version_tuple orders them).

The player picks the channel in Settings (update_channel, master when never set). Each channel
reads only its own releases: master never takes a pre-release or a "-dev." version, dev only
pre-releases whose tag, version and asset name all have the dev shape. A built copy says which
build it is in build.json beside the exe (write_build); a copy without one is __version__.

Updating goes in three steps:

  1. latest() asks GitHub for the newest release of the channel; the window says what's new and asks.
  2. download() + unpack() put the new folder in update/new, next to the exe.
  3. start_apply() verifies a paused NEW UncleFarmer.exe from update/new. Only after the window
     closes and __main__ releases its locks is copying authorized. The helper also verifies that
     the old process exited, prepares a complete release on the same volume, and swaps entries
     with rollback. It reports the result and restarts the application separately.

update/ is the staging folder: only the download, the unpacked copy, the result and busy.json
(who is using it) live there, and clean() empties and removes it once nothing uses it. Every step
is written to logs/update.log with the app's other logs, so a cleanup never takes the log away.

The Nuitka release is flat: exe, DLLs, package folders, agent/, data/, lang/, docs/ and files beside
the exe. Shipped folders are replaced, preserving KEEP_IN entries; build inventories identify
obsolete runtime entries. Character profiles, plans, scripts, settings, logs, messages,
results and anything learned (data/game_texts.json, agent/run) are never in a release, so they stay.

The releases are public, so no login is needed. UNCLEFARMER_GITHUB_TOKEN (a read-only token)
still works for a private fork's releases; without one, a private repository has no update to offer.
