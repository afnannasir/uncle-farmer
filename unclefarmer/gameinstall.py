"""Finding Mist World, and adding Uncle Farmer's agent to it.

The game is a Java program launched by mw.exe, which passes every line of mw.exe.vmoptions to Java.
One line there loads our agent:

    -javaagent:<Uncle Farmer>\\agent\\unclefarmer-agent.jar=<Uncle Farmer>\\agent\\run

Nothing else in the game folder is changed. The original file is kept once as
mw.exe.vmoptions.bak-unclefarmer. Some other tools (mwMod) delete every -javaagent line when they start
the game; if the agent stops answering after using one, install it again.

A game loads the agent only as it starts, so a reinstall (the line gone or pointing at another
Uncle Farmer, or a game running without this copy's agent) closes the open games first:
stale_games() finds them, close_games() closes them.
